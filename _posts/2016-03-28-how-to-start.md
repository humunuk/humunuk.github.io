title: How to start? (this blogging thing)
---

This evening I am having awesome moment of realizing where I am today.

If I would have asked myself one year ago, where I am today, I wouldn't dare to answer. I had dreams that one day I am developer, that one day I am gone from the job I was doing.

Last January (2015) I started to learn programming (PHP). I had tryed to do this few times in my life, always ending it after completing tutorials (PHP, MySQL, C++, Python). It was because I had no real goal and no real project.
This time it was different - I had goal - I wanted to know how to write programs, and I had project - I wanted to make website that would provide people information about those "annoying" phone numbers that call you and ask for your time, then when they see unknown number, they could check it up and see if the number was worth answering (e.g not on the list).

Thats where I started. I remember how I did my first form submitting: simple form that took a number (no validation) and entered it into database with small explanation, it took me whole day (I am not kidding, it took me over 8hours to get it to work - prior to that I had watched several hours http://teamtreehouse.com tutorials [which I still think are the best for beginner]).

Today I am Junior (back-end) developer in company called GoWorkaBit, I have worked here for 5 months which means that 10months after I started working I landed a job in that area, just one month prior to landing a job in GoWorkaBit I had started school again (it was my 3rd after graduating high-school).

So far lessons learned:

* Programming is 85% of "thinking" about solution, 10% of coding and 95% of making sure your code works.
	- What I mean by "thinking" is figuring out architecure needed for your code to work, understanding requirements of what should be done.
	- So 85+10+95 = 190% ?? Because so far I have been too opimistic about my goal of when the job will be finished.
	- Testing your code is as much developement process as is planning and coding, and you should account for that.
* Not thinking about solution and not writing code is worse than creating bad code and finding a solution
	- Thats where good team comes in. When you create bad code and go over deadline, you have team members support and then they can help to point out your mistakes and you will have better idea how to do it better next time (or right now). Thats why code review is necessity.
	- This also means that you can show your team what you have done, even if it is bad, you can still show that, something is done and can be improved.
* Sometime you just want to throw everything out of window
	- It means you have tryed 10000 and 1 solutions and none of them worked.
	- It also means, you are one step closer to solution.
	- It also means that when you are on that situation, reading this will not help - a good sleep on the other hand and relaxing will, though. ;)
* That syntax error means YOU have done something wrong, not computer has it wrong.
* Don't expect to know anything about your next assignment, it is not going to happen, you will basically start all process over again.
* Be honest with your team, like honestly, be honest where you are and what kind of help you will need.
* If you do not know, then you do not know - don't make it appear like you do know.

What would be my goals (software developement) for the next year?

I am starting to analyze how to better integrated planning into process of development in small teams (means in teams where you are the architect, analyst and programmer).

I would like to give a talk about my experience and software development for beginners in general in Tartu Garage48Hub.

I would like to develope my skills in general in software developement.

I would like to have a go to framework how to plan assignment.
